# Stream Player Pro Documentation

*** 

Pro Feature Documentation is included where relevant within the existing Free version documentation, marked with `[Pro]`.

But in order to find the Pro feature documentation more easily, an index is provided here linking to each of those sections.

Note that additional Pro Documentation will be added in the relevant section as new Features are released into the Pro version. 

If you are interested in testing cutting edge features in development for this next release, read about [Installing the Development Version](./FAQ.md#how-do-i-install-the-latest-development-version-for-testing) and [Pro Beta Version Testing](./#pro-beta-version-testing).
