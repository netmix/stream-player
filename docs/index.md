### Quickstart Guide

Once you have installed and activated the **Stream Player** plugin on your WordPress site, your WordPress Admin area will now have a new menu item titled Stream Player with submenu page items. Note if you have a specific question, you can check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](./FAQ.md) as you may find the answer there.

Firstly, you can visit the Plugin Settings screen to adjust the default [Plugin Options](./Options.md) to your liking. Here you can set your Streaming URL and Station Logo, as well as other global plugin settings. 

There are a number of [Widgets](./Widgets.md) you can add to your site via your *Appearance -> Widgets* admin submenu. These are also available as [Shortcodes](./Shortcodes.md) and [Blocks](./Widgets.md#radio-station-blocks). There are widgets for the Current Show or Playlist, and another to display Upcoming Shows. In this way you can also add a Stream Player, Radio Clock, Schedule View or Show List anywhere you like.

This plugin is under active development and we are continuously working to enhance the free version available on [WordPress.Org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream-playuer/), as well as creating new feature additions for [Stream Player Pro](https://streamplayer.pro/). 

#### [Pro] Professional Version Documentation

For ease of reference, documentation of features that are included in [Stream Player Pro](https://streamplayer.pro) are included within the Free Documentation here, simply marked with `[Pro]` like the heading above. For a list of all these features linked to their revelant sections see the [Pro Feature Index](./Pro.md)
